# FFmpeg Python Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various multimedia processing tasks using FFmpeg.
These examples showcase how to perform tasks such as video conversion, audio extraction, video stabilization, and more, leveraging the powerful FFmpeg library through its Python bindings.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system. The examples use `ffmpeg-python`, a wrapper library for FFmpeg, to interact with FFmpeg from Python scripts.

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) - Ensure FFmpeg is installed and its binaries are added to your system's PATH.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python 3.6 or higher is required.
